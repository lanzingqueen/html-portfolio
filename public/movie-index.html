<h2>Movies for a Rainy Day or to Cheer Me Up</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>She gets kidnapped, he gets killed, but it all ends up okay. 
    This gem has everything: fencing, fighting, torture, revenge,
     giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles...</p>
<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>I watched this one every day, multiple times a day when I was 
    three years old. It just makes me feel safe and cozy. It may not 
    be for everyone, but it's there for me.</p>
<h3>Some Like It Hot</h3>
<p>This black and white gem features Jack Lemmon, Marilyn Monroe, 
    and Tony Curtis in a hilarious trek where the guys dress in drag 
    to evade gangsters and travel to Florida with an all-girls band. 
    It also has one of the best last lines of any movie ever.</p>
<h3>When Harry Met Sally</h3>
<p>This one gets me because who doesn't want to fall in love with 
    their best friend? With comedy, drama, and romance, this one tugs 
    at the heartstrings while making you laugh.</p>
